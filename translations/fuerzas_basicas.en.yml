            Club Tijuana Xoloitzcuintles has always been proud of its youth system. Since the beginning of our club, there has been a reserve youth plan for our future. The club has teams in the Under-13, 15, 17 and Under-20 and Segunda Premier categories that help develop players as they march through a path to a possible debut in the senior team.

            The path begins with the younger of athletes in our CIX system, which caters to kids in elementary school. Our system extends from Tijuana and throughout Baja California to our youth academy in Chula Vista, Calif. <a href"www.xolosacademy.com">(www.xolosacademy.com)</a> to Oxnard, Calif., and New Jersey.
